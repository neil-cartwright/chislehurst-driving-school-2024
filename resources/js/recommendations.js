            "Neil is hands down the best driving instructor I’ve ever had! His experience really showed in every lesson, and he made everything easy to follow and stress-free. He was patient, calm, and always had a positive attitude, which made a huge difference for me. With his support and clear instructions, I felt well-prepared and passed my test on the first try. I’d highly recommend Neil to anyone looking for a top-notch instructor!",

            "Neil was great. I last had lessons 12 years ago and I can be quite nervous at times but Neil is very calming and patient. Has a joke or two in him which really helps to keep the mood relaxed. He is very clear with his explanations and even when I didn't understand or immediately get something, he never made me feel silly and the feedback was constructive so I actually knew what I had to improve upon. He was reassuring when I was close to my test, making me feel like I was truly ready despite my lack of self belief. Thank you again Neil. ",

Neil really cares about the people he works with, and more importantly he makes you feel that you can do it. He always focuses on the positive aspects of your lesson. The lessons are well structured and I always felt confident that I would pass my test with Neil.  I would not recommend anyone else.",

            "Neil is a fantastic instructor. When I started I’d had a few tests previously and was lacking in confidence. Neil’s lessons made such a difference to my driving ability and helped me to feel that I could drive both safely and confidently. Everything was explained really well and Neil’s patience meant that I never felt stupid when I didn’t understand something. His friendly and calm approach made the weeks and days leading up to the test a lot less daunting. I really don’t think I would have been able to pass without Neil and would recommend him to anyone looking to learn how to drive.",

            "Neil is an absolutely fantastic driving instructor. When I started I was extremely nervous, completely lacked confidence and did not think I would ever be capable of passing the test (after 2 failed attempts with different instructors). Thankfully Neil was very patient and explained things well (he was also able to explain things in more than one way when needed, giving alternative ways to try things or think about things if I didn’t seem to be getting something). Neil is also very calm and has a good sense of humour, which helped to alleviate my nerves. He never made me feel stupid and talked me through my mistakes in a supportive and encouraging way, giving me the impression that he genuinely wanted me to do well and believed that I was capable. I always felt that Neil was teaching me to be a good driver rather than just how to pass the test, and I could feel myself making progress and becoming more confident with the things that I found most tricky (roundabouts, putting the windscreen wipers on...) with each passing lesson. Now that I have passed my test I am actually looking forward to getting out there and driving again, and I never thought I’d say that! Thanks again, Neil!",

            "I would recommend Neil to anyone as a driving instructor. He is fantastic. He is incredibly patient and kind, explains and demonstrates driving technique very well and tailors each lesson to your skills and level of confidence. Neil's experience always shows through and he is absolutely unflappable - he's also always good company! I found myself really looking forward to my driving lessons each week, and will miss them now that I've passed (first time!).",

He is patient, thorough, and will make sure you not only pass your test but learn really good driving habits to last you a lifetime. He is also great company - a really important quality in a driving instructor given that you spend hours on end with them! Absolutely delighted with my first-time pass, and will recommend the Charlton Driving School to everyone I know.",

            "I 100% recommend Neil at Charlton Driving  to anyone learning to drive in the South East area. Not only are the lessons well-structured but you also have online access to theory test materials, and a growing list of each stage learnt as you progress; so it was easy to see what you had learnt and each step was also linked to the theory book pages of that lesson – which I found really helped me with all aspects of passing my driving test. I found that Neil was very easy to talk to and made me feel very comfortable during the lessons. I particularly liked that he would test me on a few theory questions during my practical lesson as this kept the information in the forefront of my mind, and coincided nicely with the practical aspect of what I was learning. It was easy to communicate with Neil to book lessons etc and he was always very punctual, reliable and patient.Neil – thank you so much for helping me to pass my test first time!",

            "Would definitely recommend Neil as a driving instructor! At the start I was a very nervous driver. However Neil has been patient and encouraging all the way through, which has really built my confidence. He is a skilled instructor, great to talk to and very supportive. The lessons are well structured, tailored to your ability and there is flexibility to focus on things you feel would be useful as well. After every lesson you receive feedback and breakdown of what was covered. Neil also provides online support and materials, which are incredibly helpful. Thank you so much Neil for teaching me to drive (something that I thought would be an impossible task!), you’ve been the best teacher!!",

            "It's all true. Neil is a lovely person and a very clever teacher. He has a truly contagious sense of calm, is encouraging and you're never made to feel silly. Despite being a freaked out first time adult learner, I quickly gained confidence and passed first time! Couldn't recommend more highly. I was blown away by the website - a great resource when I was revising for my theory but also an easy way to keep tabs on progress, hours, money spent. You can see tips and videos that relate to each lesson and notes on what you've been working on. The whole experience was super positive. Before I knew it Neil told me I was ready to take the test. I'm going to miss those lessons! Thank you!",

Neil is patient, calm and flexible. I always felt listened to and went from dreading my lessons to looking forward to them. Today I have passed first time and I can not believe it. With 3 kids and 2 businesses having this freedom will change my life. Neil's online resources are great and having an online portal to follow up on makes the most of each lesson. Its been brilliant and the only down side of passing is missing my weekly lessons. Thank you",

He was recommended to me by my boss at work who said he was great at teaching her to drive. I can say that Neil was brilliant, he was punctual, professional and always willing to give extra help. He used special tricks and reference points for manoeuvres that I found really useful. After using him for approximately 5 months I passed the first time at Hither Green. I would fully recommend him to anyone.",

            "Once we started the first lesson, I knew straight away Neil was going to be my last driving instructor with his positive attitude towards my deafness and throughout the lessons we had over the time, he was very calm, patient, honest and friendly. He makes everything more easier by explaining why I went wrong and praising me when I did right which boosts my confidence. He did not waste any time, he always got straight to the point by teaching me things he felt I needed to improve in preparation for my test. I hugely enjoyed my time with him and I will always be grateful for having the opportunity to learn from him, I would not be a qualified driver now if it was not for him. I taught him some BSL (British sign language) which he did very well, he would not stop trying his best so this shows his attitude to disabled individuals are amazing. So rest assured, you are in the good hands if you have him as your driving instructor :)",

Needless to say, he's patient, understanding and encouraging. He's committed into getting you to drive safely and well and with the aim of achieving that pass.I genuinely can't recommend him highly enough.",

            "I failed my driving test three times in my early 20s. I unluckily had a terrible instructor the first time I learnt, who would shout when I made a mistake. After the third attempt at the driving test I stopped learning. Thinking about driving put me in a blind panic, and I had resigned myself to forever live in London, to negate the need to ever drive again. The whole experience learning to drive with that first instructor, really knocked my confidence, and it was another decade before I decided to learn again. I booked my first lesson with Neil purely because he had good reviews on his website, from people exactly like me. The reviews did not disappoint. From the first lesson to the last hour before my test, Neil has always been very calm and encouraging. Neil is an excellent teacher and good at explaining things. As a veteran Instructor he is attuned to his student’s needs, learning styles, and adapts to what suits. He will go over manoeuvres, roundabouts, where the window washer is, until you get it. As far as possible he attempts to teach you good habits, and tries to instil a good attitude driving. On top of that he is a pleasant person to spend an hour with every week with, and will bend your ear off anything Star Wars. related. Learning to drive is a bit like learning to read, it is important, and you should be able to do it well. I don’t remember who taught me how to read, but I will definitely remember who taught me how to drive properly. Having achieved my driver’s license, I now realise how much more freedom I have. For that, I am grateful to Neil for his time and effort teaching me. I would 100% recommend Neil as a driving instructor, if you’re anything like me don’t wait just start learning!",

Neil teaches you how to be a confident and considerate driver, not just how to pass your test. I am a keen cyclist and he would relate my past experience to everyday driving. Even my partner (who has had his licence for years) would learn lots of new and interesting facts from my post lesson rambles. I can drive confidently despite the best efforts of my two screaming children in the back.",

I also spoke to other people who had used them and their positive comments influenced my decision. As a teacher, I understand the fine line between challenging students and stressing them; thankfully so does Neil. He made me feel confident and in control very early in my driving. Furthermore, Charlton Driving School's friendly and flexible meant I was easily able to accomodate my learning into a fairly hectic schedule. Neil is a great guy and a brilliant instructor; highly recommend for drivers' of all ages and abilities.",

            "When I rang Neil to book an initial lesson I was feeling quite despondent about my ability to ever pass the driving test. I had taken, and failed, two driving tests previously and had had three different driving instructors. I was finding it very difficult to find an instructor that I clicked with. My previous instructors seemed either too laid back and I felt I wasn't learning and progressing. Alternatively they were rather pedantic and particular and I was left feeling anxious and flustered. So I googled 'experienced' and 'patient' driving instructor and Neil's driving school was at the top of the list. I knew I had found the right driving instructor in my very first lesson. Neil is indeed experienced and patient but he also challenged me when I needed to push myself a little. Simultaneously he maintained a relaxed and fun atmosphere and I found I was actually enjoying my driving lessons! I felt confident and prepared when it came time for me to attempt my third driving test.. and I passed! I would recommend Neil to anyone who is a nervous or demoralised learner driver. Thanks to him I am now finally mobile and transporting two small children from A to B is so much easier!",

He gives 100% or more to teaching. He is a patient, extremely knowledgeable teacher. If you really want to be a skilled driver and feel confident at what you do then pick Neil. A lot of the skills he was teaching me was at advanced level driving. I feel very grateful for Neil getting me through my test. I passed, yay!",
