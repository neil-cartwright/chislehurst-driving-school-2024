                essential skills they need to stay safe in a wide
                variety of road and traffic conditions. Lessons are
                focused on achieving a predefined goal and on
                gaining valuable driving experience. A positive
                attitude towards other road users is strongly
                encouraged. 90% of my customers pass their test on
                either the first or second attempt.&rdquo;

            I use a nearly new manual gearbox Skoda Fabia training vehicle. It is
            equipped with stop/start technology and has very low co2
            emmisions. The vehicle is dual controlled, with climate control air
            conditioning. The vehicle has lots of varied seating positions and is great for people of all shapes and
            sizes. I use the same TomTom 52 Sat Nav as driving
            examiners on tests.
