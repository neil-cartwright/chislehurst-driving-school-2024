        <p>I'm based in Chislehurst, not far from New Eltham. I can also pick up from Greenwich University campus at
            Avery Hill.</p>
        <p>I've been a driving instructor since 2004 and during that time I've taught hundreds of people across South
            East London.</p>
        <p>New Eltham is served by the nearest driving test centres which are all not too far away; Sidcup, Bromley,
            Hither Green and
            Belvedere. </p>
        <p>I work 10am-8pm Monday to Thursday, and 8am-5pm on Saturday. </p>
        <p>I provide full theory test support including free access to theory test pro.</p>
